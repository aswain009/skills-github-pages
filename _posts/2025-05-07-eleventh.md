excerpt: "well i said i would keep at it."

Initial excitement and novelty has worn off.

I was looking over the posts I was making and noticed a trend. I posted 3 posts in 3 days, then a week later, then I forgot and posted after two weeks, then again the following week. Then it has settled into a two week system. I am realizing as I write this out that I have lost interest and excitement in this process. I am just writing because I said I would and at this point in my life the only things I am really doing are things I said I would do. Working, chores, doctors appointments, paying bills. These things are as Raptitude states “Default activities” things that need to get done but do not provide any fulfillment in life or provide an opportunity to do what we want. I thought that this blog might be something that I want to do but it turns out it was just excitement from reading Raptitude and thinking “I could do that!”. So here I am nine posts into the void and im already bored or uninterested, or whatever the emotion I am feeling is. Ennui pronounced On-We is a word that I have not heard or thought of in a long time. Google believes it is a good word to define the feeling I am having towards this. It’s not disdain or anything negative it’s just total lack of interest and boredom.

Ennui is probably a feeling I get most of the time. Just a general lack of interest in things or a general sense of boredom even when doing things I should enjoy or things I have said I would enjoy doing. Like writing this blog, playing video games, cooking, learning new things, reading/talking about space. I just don’t find any fulfillment, satisfaction, or joy from these things. Or if I do feel something like the emotion listed it is fleeting and only lasts for an hour or so.

This could be a direct result of the times we live in and the instant gratification we feel we need all the time. Things that are supposed to deliver that feeling don’t for me. Like scrolling on tictok or reddit, playing a video game or watching a stream. None of those things provide me with a feeling of joy or fulfillment. They mostly just make me aware of the amount of time I have waisted doing this thing. Yeah, I may laugh a bit or find parts of a game fun or engaging but when im done I don’t feel like it was time well spent.  
You could say that I need to do something productive, the down side is I don’t have any skills. I can build things, I am not artistic, I can’t play and instrument, im not good enough at math or physics to conceptualize random thought and test them, the last one sounds the most fun but currently im in school for web development and working 2 jobs I don’t think I have the mental capability to teach myself advanced calculus to prove mathematical theories of space and time, at least not at the moment.

You know what, screw it. Im going to go down this rabbit hole, Im going to attempt to teach myself the math and problem solving concepts I need to learn to become a backyard physicist. I need a goal though, not some unrealistic goal of proving string theory or, finding a unified theory of everything. A reasonable goal that would prove I know something about physics and space. This blog will now be my journey towards this goal.

I have three experiments that I can look into and begin to build out and work on to tackle some more advanced theories of astrophysics. They also use computer programming so it’s a good place to work. I will begin to tackle the first one, I will create a git repo and push the code to be able to work on it whenever. This sounds fun and exciting, and I have a goal and will build out a plan to follow it. 
 Theoretical Astronomy Experiments
1. Simulating Planetary Orbits
   Use numerical methods (e.g., Python or MATLAB) to simulate planetary orbits. Investigate orbital resonance, stability, and chaos.
2. Stellar Evolution Modeling
   Use stellar evolution codes (e.g., MESA) to model the evolution of stars. Investigate the effects of mass, metallicity, and rotation on stellar evolution.
3. Galaxy Dynamics Simulation
   Use N-body simulations (e.g., GADGET) to model galaxy dynamics. Investigate galaxy mergers, star formation, and dark matter.
