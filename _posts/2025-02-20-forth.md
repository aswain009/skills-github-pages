excerpt: "The Pomodoro Technique."
---


AI is great, this is a question I asked an AI bot yesterday when I was reading a blog
Q: Are you familiar with The Pomodoro Technique.
R: Yes, I'm familiar with the Pomodoro Technique. It is a popular time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique is named after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer (Pomodoro is Italian for tomato) that Cirillo used as a university student.
The Pomodoro Technique breaks work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as "Pomodoros." The method is designed to improve focus and productivity by encouraging frequent breaks to reduce mental fatigue.
Here's a basic overview of how the technique works:
1. Choose a Task: Select a task you want to work on.
2. Set the Timer: Set a timer for 25 minutes (one Pomodoro).
3. Work on the Task: Focus on the task until the timer rings. If you get distracted or remember something else you need to do, write it down and return to the task at hand.
4. Take a Short Break: When the timer rings, take a 5-minute break. Use this time to relax, stretch, grab a drink, or do something non-work-related.
5. Repeat: After the break, start another Pomodoro. Every four Pomodoros, take a longer break of 15-30 minutes.
   The key principles of the Pomodoro Technique include:
* Breaking down work into manageable intervals to make tasks feel less overwhelming and easier to start.
* Implementing regular breaks to help maintain mental agility and avoid burnout.
* Encouraging focus and concentration by dedicating short bursts of time to work without interruptions.
* Tracking progress by recording completed Pomodoros, which can provide a sense of accomplishment and motivation.
  The Pomodoro Technique is flexible, and users can adjust the length of the work and break intervals based on their preferences and the nature of their tasks. It's a simple yet effective method for improving productivity and managing time more efficiently.

This idea intrigues me not only because I see the benefits but also the implications for “work life balance” or “how cooperate America works”.  Personally I get distracted all the time, looping back to ADHD potential, I find it hard or tedious to sit and stare at code for hours on end. When the work has lost its initial spark or chutzpah (pronounced hoots-pah) I feel like it becomes a chore to continue working on. One of the main reasons why I started the blog at work, to make it seem like I am working and to pass the time. I hope this doesn’t get found by my job, well editing is a thing for a reason!

Anyways, the work 25 rest method just provides me enough time to do something productive, but then rest as I feel the productivity begin to decline. Which I am already feeling about this blog, who would have thought typing and keeping mildly coherent stream of thought together would take so much effort. 

So I tried this technique for the day I read about it and realized it takes a lot of effort to not only keep track of the time your working, without a noticeable alarm disturbing my colleagues every 25 min, but to also remember to reset the timer, and to stop after 25 min? If im knee deep in a coding problem im not going to just drop everything after 25 min and then be able to pick it back up after a short break. I would have to re-read the code and the problem to get back into the groove of things. This would definitely hinder my progress and make me feel like I am not getting anything done.

I feel that this method of work is good for some people in some fields, like if i was building something physical, or drawing something, or writing a paper this would be a great way to keep on track and not get lost in the weeds. So I will look to find another system of working that will help me stay on track, or just move forward with this ADHD diagnosis and realize that I dont need any focusing techniques and just need a bit of help getting things sorted out in my head.
