excerpt: "Honestly I dont know what to write about."
---
I realized I haven't put anything here in a while. I don't know when I will post again, but I felt like I should. 
I have come to a realization that I dont know much about anything. I was getting this, apparently false, sense that I 
knew what I was talking about when it came to coding and software development. I realized that I don't know what I am talking about.

I have, in my opinion, the most baseline understanding of this whole field. I can write code that works, 
I can test it, I can debug, I can explain it to others, I can take others' code and improve upon it and make it better. But There
is so much that I dont know. Things dealing with memory leaks, the intricate nature of machine code, the working of complicated
tech stacks like kubernaties, clusters, APIs sitting on data layers, across distrubuted networks, and so much more. I feel like I have only scratched the surface of what software development is.
I want to learn more, I want to grow, there is just so much that it is actively overwhelming. I have a bachelor's degree and have been 
working in the tech industry for almost 10 years. Some would say that I am a "senior" developer, but I am not. I am a junior developer.

The one thing that I will say makes me believe that I am a junior is that I have yet to pass a technical interview. I have failed every single one.
I have never been able to get past the whiteboard coding portion of an interview. I have always struggled with the thought to code interaction when not at a keyboard,
the other thing is now AI is mostly doing the "heavy lifting" setting up projects, verifying skelitons, adding basic code to the projects. Yeah when there are
errors I can get thigns working but I take the error and paste it into AI then take the response and paste it into the code. It errors again rinse and repeat. 
There are moents when I fix things, erase the AI code and then start from where things worked and iterate slowly but that is few and far between.

I guess i just feel like a fruad and am riddled with imposter syndrome.

maybe just a rant, maybe truth. I dont know.
