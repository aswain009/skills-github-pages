excerpt: "Posting to pretend im keeping up with it."

So posting is now not as easy as it used to be. Being medicated for ADHD has made it so I can focus on work at work and no longer need a distraction to get through the day.
Since that is the case and i usually wrote these posts at work, I have not been writing them. Which I feel is a good thing since I am now able to focus on my work and get things done that need to be done.
So the medication is working and I am able to maintain extended focus on tasks and projects so I do not have time to write. I will still post small upadtes to maintain a presence on the blog but I probably won't have indepth postings and thoughts as often.
