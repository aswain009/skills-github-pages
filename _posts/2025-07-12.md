excerpt: "Posting to attempt to keep up with it"

I mean its kind of a good thing that i "dont have time to post" i have been enjoying my work and focusing on that. I have been working on school and the projects related to the class I am taking.
Not being able to or thinking about posting to this blog just means, at least to me that I am doing other things that i feel are important. I have also not bee keeping up with the blog that inspired
me to start my own, i jsut havent had the desire to focus on those thigs. I have been able to accomplish goals and mile stones at work and in life that allow me to move in the direction i want. 
I do believe this is fueled by the ADHD diagnosis and treatment. It allows me to do something like this where i accomplish a goald, writing this blog, while knowing i have other things to do and then 
i can jsut get back to the other things with minimal effort or issues switching tasks. I feel the diagnosis and medication are really helping me. I will attempt to update agin in a month or so, maybe.
