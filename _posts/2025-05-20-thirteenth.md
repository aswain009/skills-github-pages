excerpt: "It has officially become a struggle to post."

So I am writing this post now (2025/05/07) so I don’t feel rushed when I have nothing to post and scramble to get something down in two weeks.
I have really fallen off the posting train. I was all excited about it and ready to go initially, but my work life has changed, and now I am more engaged with my work, so I am not tempted to “Find things to fill my time” as I have a lot of things that I feel like I enjoy working on.
I have also been diagnosed and am now medicated for ADHD. The meds really do allow me to focus on something for an extended period of time. 
I feel like I am able to maintain focus on tasks and keep on track of what I need to do with the meds. 
I was able to get my work done before but I would constantly feel bored or uninterested in the work I was doing after a few weeks of focusing on the same thing. 
Now I am about 3 weeks into my meds and I am not bothered by the monotony of working on the same task every day, 
I feel like there is a greater sense of accomplishment for getting things where they need to be now, and the delayed gratification is worth it.
I have been working on a lot of different things so that could also have been helping. I don’t really know what else to say.
I kind of want to get back to work and continue with the projects I have in front of me. I am going to keep posting every other week or a time frame close to that. 
However, I am not sure if the posts will contain anything worth while or if these are now a relic of me when I was off my meds.
