I have recently been working on a school project to build a PWA( Progressive Web App) for a class. I decided to build a simple storefront
with some generic functionality to explore the workings of a PWA. I have only spent about 6 or so hours on the project in total, and it's 
already done. I have a working deployed app that can be converted into a PWA and "installed" on a phone. It's built using Next.js and Vercel 
and was a lot easier than I thought it would be. I used boilerplate code and a good chunk of AI help to build the app, it's working, and 
I was able to learn a lot about how PWAs work and how to build them. I am pretty proud of myself for getting it done so quickly. So I decided to 
make a post about it. It's not much, but it was something that I wanted to learn. I feel mildly accomplished and also learned that there is a lot more 
to learn and understand about PWAs before I feel like I have the hang of them. I will probably continue to work on the app and add more features to it 
as I learn more about PWAs and web development in general.
